The USGS wants you to plot a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. You will need to pull in a second data set and visualize it along side your original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.


Analysis: The visulization created using the 7 day Sesimic activity data and the Techtonic Plates data, it is evident that the earthquakes are prominient closer to the fault lines.
